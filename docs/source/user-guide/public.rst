How to make your images public
==============================

1. Make a request to an administrator for a public group
========================================================

Include the name of the group, which should be formatted as:

“PRIMARY AUTHORS (MAX 2)” et al. “[DOI LINK]”

OR

LABNAME NEW PUB

Include the description of the group, which should be a brief
explaination of the paper/project.

2. Upload your images
=====================

Or if they're already uploaded to your private repository, right-click
to move the project folder to the correct group.

Reorganise once moved, if necessary.

3. Make sure they follow all naming and annotation standards
============================================================

This should be close to automatic if you are using the template
provided.

-  Project name format
-  Dataset name format
-  Key-Value annotations
-  MMA json attached
-  Ontologies
-  etc.

4. Submit to an administrator for review
========================================
