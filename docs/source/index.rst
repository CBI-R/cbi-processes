Welcome to the Canada Bio-Imaging Resource's documentation!
===========================================================

This page hosts the documentation and processes for CBI-R.

Microscopy research generates large, multi-dimensional datasets. CBI-R is a unique cloud-based microscopy 
data visualization, management, annotation and sharing infrastructure. It is an instance of the open source 
tool OMERO (Open Microscopy Environment Remote Object), a member of the ImageJ open source ecosystem widely 
used in microscopy. We have created tools to automate metadata annotation and data upload into CBI-R, enabling 
analysis pipeline storage and access to advanced cloud-based computing for reproducible data analysis. 
CBI-R supports microscopy data management throughout the data lifecycle, in alignment with findability, 
accessibility, interoperability, and reusability (FAIR) data and Open Science principles.
